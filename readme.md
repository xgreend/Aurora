## Help Maintain Aurora
Since I, Korbs, am the developer of a different theme, I don't use Aurora as much as you would. So I won't always be there to update Aurora when Discord updates and breaks code in the theme. So if you're experienced with CSS, feel free to make a [pull request](https://github.com/KorbsStudio/Aurora/pulls) if you want.
